## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have Python installed. You can install the required Python packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Setting Up the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare the Data:**
   - Place your raw data files in the `data/raw/` directory.
   - If the data is not present, the program will attempt to download it automatically when you run the scripts.

## Usage

### 1. Data Preparation

The `dataset.py` script handles data loading and preprocessing. To check if the data is present and load it if necessary, use:

```python
from src.data.dataset import check_and_load_data

data_path = "data/raw/housing.csv"
if check_and_load_data(data_path):
    print("Data is ready for processing.")
```

### 2. Model Training

To train a machine learning model, run the `train.py` script in the `modeling` directory. This script handles the entire model training process, including hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV`.

```python
from src.modeling.train import prepare_data, train_model

# Assuming `housing` DataFrame is already loaded
X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test = prepare_data(housing)

# Train the model
best_model = train_model(X_train, y_train)
```

### 3. Model Inference

To make predictions with a trained model, use the `predict.py` script in the `modeling` directory. This script includes functions to measure confidence intervals using both t-scores and bootstrapped methods.

```python
from src.modeling.predict import predict_with_confidence

y_test_predictions, ci_t_scores, ci_bootstrap = predict_with_confidence(best_model, X_test, y_test)
```

### 4. Saving and Loading Models

The trained models can be saved and loaded using functions defined in the `predict.py` script.

```python
from src.modeling.predict import save_model, load_model

save_model(best_model, "models/my_model.pkl")
loaded_model = load_model("models/my_model.pkl")
```

## Testing

To run tests, ensure that the test scripts are located in a `tests/` directory, and use `pytest` or another testing framework of your choice.
